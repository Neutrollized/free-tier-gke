# Tetragon

I wrote a couple of Medium articles on Tetragon [here](https://medium.com/@glen.yu/getting-started-with-tetragon-on-gke-2c11549720b0) and [here](https://medium.com/google-cloud/google-cloud-logging-and-cloud-monitoring-example-with-tetragon-5eb2012066d4)

This example requires the GKE Dataplane V2 feature be enabled.

## Setup
```console
helm repo add cilium https://helm.cilium.io
helm repo update
helm install tetragon cilium/tetragon -n kube-system
```

- upgrade:
```console
helm upgrade tetragon cilium/tetragon -n kube-system
```

### Configuration
If you want to update Tetragon's config, you can do so by editing ConfigMap:
```console
kubectl edit configmap -n kube-system tetragon-config
```
You can, for example, set `enable-process-cred` to `true`, will enable visibility to capability changes/privileged execution (i.e. `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`)

After you've made your changes, you will need to restart the Tetragon daemonset with:
```console
kubectl rollout restart -n kube-system ds/tetragon
```

### Tetragon CLI
I suggest making an alias if you don't already have the Tetragon CLI installed on your system, as you will be calling `tetra` from one of the tetragon containers (if you want to use `tetra` that's on your local system, replace `ktetra`):

```console
alias ktetra='kubectl exec -it -n kube-system ds/tetragon -c tetragon -- tetra '
alias tetralogs='kubectl logs -n kube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=tetragon -c export-stdout -f | ktetra getevents -o compact '
```
(the second alias will be more relevant later on)


```console
ktetra status

ktetra version
```

- output:
```
Health Status: running

CLI version: v1.0.1
```

#### Sample usage
```console
tetralogs --namespace default --pods myapp
```


## Tracing Policy examples

### [fd_install](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6.7/source/fs/file.c#L602) (Basic)
The kernel function, `fd_install` is called when a new file descriptor needs to be created.  The following policy prevents a few file descriptor from being created (or opened if it already exists), provided that file is */tmp/tetragon*.  It will trigger a SIGKILL to kill off the pocess trying to create the file:
```console
kubectl apply -f ./block-fd-install.yaml
```

- notice how writing to */tmp/bar* is okay, but */tmp/tetragon* will trigger an SIGKILL on the process (in my case, the kubectl exec -it /bin/bash shell)
```
bash-4.3# echo 'foo' > /tmp/bar
bash-4.3# echo 'foo' > /tmp/tetragon
command terminated with exit code 137
```

### fd_install (Intermediate)
For a little more advanced example, deploy my `nginx-deployment.yaml` example (one folder up) and then apply the `block-nginx-write-index.yaml`:
```console
kubectl apply -f ../nginx-deployment.yaml

kubectl apply -f ./block-nginx-write-index.yaml
```

The following block ignores (`NotIn`) the container's init PID (in our case, NGINX).  Because this policy blocks the `fd_install` kernel function, we do not want to preven NGINX from reading the index.html.  This sets the stage to apply the policy only to other PIDs (i.e. from `kubectl exec`).  This is a fairly common pattern, so learn to recognize it:
```yaml
    - matchPIDs:
      - operator: "NotIn"
        followForks: false
        isNamespacePID: true
        values:
        - 0
        - 1
```

- matches argument to be anything in the following path list:
```yaml
      matchArgs:
      - index: 1
        operator: "Prefix"
        values:
        - "/usr/share/nginx/html/"
```

- finally, allowlist the `cat` command (so you can open the file provided it's with `cat`, but `sed`, `vi` or anything else not in this list will get sent a SIGKILL):
```yaml
      matchBinaries:
      - operator: "NotIn"
        values:
         - "/usr/bin/cat"
```


### [tcp_connect](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6.7/source/net/ipv4/tcp_output.c#L3946), [tcp_sendmsg](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6.7/source/net/ipv4/tcp.c#L1335), and [tcp_close](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.6.7/source/net/ipv4/tcp.c#L2918)
These kprobes are used for creating a tcp connection, sending data and closing the connection respectively.  Applying this will add extra entries in the `tetra getevents -o compact` output (or in our case, `ktetra`).

```console
kubectl apply -f ./log-tcp-connection.yaml
```

- below is a sample output of `kubectl exec -it tiefighter -n galaxy -- curl -XPOST deathstar.galaxy.svc.cluster.local/v1/request-landing` with the [Starwars demo app](../cilium/starwars-demo/http-sw-app.yaml):
```
ðŸš€ process galaxy/tiefighter /usr/bin/curl -s -XPOST deathstar.galaxy.svc.cluster.local/v1/request-landing
ðŸ”Œ connect galaxy/tiefighter /usr/bin/curl tcp 10.0.0.7:43724 -> 10.1.11.240:80
ðŸ“¤ sendmsg galaxy/tiefighter /usr/bin/curl tcp 10.0.0.7:43724 -> 10.1.11.240:80 bytes 117
ðŸ§¹ close   galaxy/tiefighter /usr/bin/curl tcp 10.0.0.7:43724 -> 10.1.11.240:80
ðŸ’¥ exit    galaxy/tiefighter /usr/bin/curl -s -XPOST deathstar.galaxy.svc.cluster.local/v1/request-landing 0
```

### Block Internet egress
The following policy blocks any egress traffic that is outside of the CIDRs specified.  In my case it was *127.0.0.1* (localhost), *10.0.0.0/18* (pod CIDR, `cluster_ipv4_cidr_block` Terraform variable value) and *10.1.0.0/20* (services CIDR, `services_ipv4_cidr_block` Terraform variable value):
```console
kubectl apply -f ./block-internet-egress.yaml
```

You will also notice that this is a `TracingPolicyNamespaced`, which works the same way as a `TracingPolicy`, except it is namespace-scoped (as you can probably already guess)

- you get the following if you try to access something outside the specified CIDR ranges from within a pod:
```
# curl www.google.com
Killed
```
